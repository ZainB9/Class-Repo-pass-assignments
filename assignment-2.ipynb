      " \"hello! i've just had the opportunity to try this. these sensors are very sensitive, so i am unable to do this unless i modify the application simply have it count upwards, then log when the numbers above 25 are reached, but this may still require a slightly altered approach when receiving from the serial port. i attempted to modify the serial port section accordingly, but it doesn't seem able to contain the logging mechanism unless i am doing it incorrectly. unfortunately, it seems as if the only approach is to have the logging mechanism span several classes order to properly redirect the output, then continually output to the console simultaneously. so, i think this becomes complex, least when it comes to copying the console output to a text file when a condition is reached. i of course know how my code works, but i'm not sure where to apply anything more so that it works as expected when it comes to this particular feature. that's why i'm asking someone with more experience with this language. i have a tendency to make issues appear much more complex than they might be, so i may be overlooking the obvious solution here. act of having the program behave differently depending on a condition isn't the hard part particular this case, it's mostly because of the apparent complexity involved with getting this to work as desired when a number is reached. obviously, the general scope is to have the file logging suspended when it is below, but as soon as the temperature reaches over, the logging resumes. temperature is not given decimals as is customary, but you wouldn't know the calculations for the temperature because the arduino code is not included here. it isn't very relevant to this issue, as the needs to do the work to store the information. i would have preferred to write this to an sd _ card connected to the arduino board, but that would have been beyond the scope of this project. all you essentially see are numbers, nothing else. that conforms to the project requirements. so, summary, i wouldn't mind a definitive reply due to my lack of understanding for this particular language. in\"\n",
      " \"ummm, i really don't see why the sensitivity of the probe matters all, what matters is the form of data the device produces. if you could describe that it would likely be your best route to some actual help. if you want to log to the file every time you get a temperature reading but only log to the console when you get a reading over 25c that would still be a matter for your datareceived event handler, it would just have two actions instead of one. one thing to add, i would be somewhat surprised if such a device were to produce data that could meaningfully be shoved into a string as - is. likely would be to read the incoming data into a byte array ( using serialport. ( byte [ ], int32, int32 ) work with it from there.\"\n",
      " \"hi! you already know the type of data the device produces. what i have outlined is quite literally what it needs to do, how it shows it. it doesn't display anything but numbers as output, that's all the device currently is required to do. i'll change certain things around later once i actually get this to function as expected, but this won't change anything all except how the information is presented the file, so it will still be capable of logging it as long as the numbers don't change. solution itself is actually incredibly simple, i'm just not sure where or how to make the adjustment given how the information is actually logged to the file, unless there is an easier way to deploy such a feature without losing console output. in summary, what i need is a console application which reads the serial data from the com port after choosing which port to use. when the program begins reading the data, it shows each reading on a different line so the numbers don't actually blend together. only information that will be shown are numbers, like 25, nothing more than that. that's the exact number format. when the number is greater than 25, the will start to log the incoming information, but hopefully it's still possible to show console output while logging the information. once the temperature decreases down to 25 below, the logging stops. i'm really sure i cannot make it clearer than that. solution is obvious - make an if statement that, when the number is greater than 25, starts to log the information to file. even the problem is a very simple algorithm. currently, the only function the application does not perform is logging when the temperature increases above 25, that is the part that needs fixing so that it does what it needs to do. as mentioned above, that is actually how the numbers show up. again, if it's smarter to drop the code for the real time output logging, i suppose it isn't a huge deal if the numbers above 25 don't show as long as they write to the file. that's pretty much what's important, what needs to work. numbers below do not need to be written to the file all, just displayed the console. i can't tell you more than this, since that's actually all there is to it, so i can't elaborate. this is how the data is displayed, the form of data it is, its purpose function. it really doesn't bother me how a solution is reached, as long as it logs anything above the number of 25, discards anything below that only shows it the console. that's all that matters. that should clear things up if it wasn't clear to begin with. thanks!\"\n",
      " 'no, i do not know what data the device produces. i mean, it could be something like { time - stamp } { temp reading } or maybe just { temp reading }, or it could be something else entirely. data could already be formatted as a string or it might be pure binary. i do not know any of those things, yet that is exactly what is needed order to be able to perform any sort of tests on the data read from the probe.'\n",
